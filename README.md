Provides a quick-and-dirty method to get a user's / group's games using Roblox's Web API, and a little extra!
Initially written as a personal utility (and to learn Python, in a way), now I guess it's ready for the world?

## Usage

It is recommended that you run this script in it's own folder, as it can write text files containing whatever information you obtain through this script. If you do not plan to use this feature, then you don't have to. Everything else is as straight-forward as I can be bothered to make it right now

## Requirements

Python version 3.10 or greater (because old habits die hard)
That's pretty much it (unless you dont have these modules: sys, os, requests, json, webbrowser. but those should be included already i think)

## Disclaimer

I am not responsible for whatever you do when using this script.
If you utilize this script in a malicious manner or in other ways that go against [Roblox's ToS](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use), your account might be penalized. 


If you somehow decide you want to utilize this in one of your own projects, feel free to mail me a link to it! Also crediting back to this page would be nice too. I'll even link you below if you do!
